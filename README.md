## Bamazon

 - An Amazon-like storefront web application. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. You can also program the app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.


 #Bamazon Customer
 - Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale.
 - Once the customer has placed the order, the application will check if the stores inventory has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

 #Bamazon Manager
- Running this application will list a set a menu options:
    - View Products for Sale

    - View Low Inventory

    - Add to Inventory

    - Add New Product

-  If a manager selects View Products for Sale, the app will list every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.

- If a manager selects View Low Inventory, then it will list all items with an inventory count lower than five.

- If a manager selects Add to Inventory, the app will display a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.

- If a manager selects Add New Product, it will allow the manager to add a completely new product to the store.
